# Analysis of Cycling Data

This project explores data generated from a series of cycling races. The portfolio was split into the following sections:

### 1.1 Import Libraries and Read Data Set 
### 1.2 Preliminary Investigation
* The data was inspected and dirty data identified
### 1.3 Data Cleaning 
* The processes by which the data was cleaned is explained
### 1.4 Data Summary of Rides
* The rides were statistically summarised and represented graphically 
### 1.5 Comparing Ride Speed
 * A one-way ANOVA test was conducted to investigate the differences in average speed between the rides
### 1.6 Time Trial Comparison
* The speeds achieved during the two time trial races were compared to identify fastest segments
### 1.7 Climbing/Descending Speeds
* The average speeds between differences in climbing gradient where calculated and compared
### 1.8 Challenge: Gear Usage
* The distribution of development was compared between races to gain insights regarding the usage of gears
